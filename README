64-bit ARM OS/Kernel/Systems Development on an nVidia Shield TV
===============================================================

The Shield TV is based on the 64-bit nVidia X1 chip.

The Shield TV allows performing an unlock via "fastboot oem unlock", allowing custom OS images to be booted.

What this is
=============

This is a small demo, demonstrating how to build and boot arbitrary code on your Shield TV.

What you need - required
========================

* A Shield TV, unlocked. Search Youtube for walkthroughs.
* GNU Make.
* An AArch64 GNU toolchain.
* ADB/Fastboot tools.
* Bootimg tools (https://github.com/pbatard/bootimg-tools),
  built and somewhere in your path.
* An HDMI-capable screen. Note, HDMI, not DVI-HDMI adapter. You want the firmware to configure
  the screen into 1920x1080 mode, otherwise you'll be in 640x480 and we don't want that...

How to build
============

$ CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- make

... should yield 'shieldTV_demo'.

How to boot
===========

* Connect the Shield TV a USB cable to your dev workstation.

* $ adb reboot-bootloader

  ...you should now see the nvidia splash screen, followed by the menu.

* $ fastboot boot shieldTV_demo

  ...the code will upload. You will see drawn diagonal black lines on a green background. The green
  background means you're running in EL2. Woowwwwwzers!

Where to go from here
=====================

- nv-tegra.nvidia.com/gitweb/?p=linux-3.10.git;a=summary
- no idea where the TRM would be, but a lot of the peripherals seem to match the K1 (UART...), it's
  a Tegra after all. Use the DTS for the real bases.
